The OpenEuropa Authentication module allows to authenticate against EU Login, the European Commission login service.

## Installation

The recommended way of installing the OpenEuropa Authentication module is via [Composer][2].

```bash
composer require openeuropa/oe_authentication
```

### Enable the module

In order to enable the module in your project run:

```
$ ./vendor/bin/drush en oe_authentication
```

EU Login service parameters are already set by default when installing the module. Please refer to the EU Login documentation for the available options that can
be specified. You can see Project setup section on how to override these parameters.

## Development

The OpenEuropa Authentication project contains all the necessary code and tools for an effective development process,
such as:

- All PHP development dependencies (Drupal core included) are required by [composer.json](composer.json)
- Project setup and installation can be easily handled thanks to the integration with the [Task Runner][3] project.
- All system requirements are containerized using [Docker Composer][4]
- A mock server for testing.

### Project setup

Download all required PHP code by running:

```
$ composer install
```

This will build a fully functional Drupal test site in the `./build` directory that can be used to develop and showcase
the module's functionality.

Before setting up and installing the site make sure to customize default configuration values by copying [runner.yml.dist](runner.yml.dist)
to `./runner.yml` and overriding relevant properties.

To set up the project run:

```
$ ./vendor/bin/run drupal:site-setup
```

This will:

- Symlink the theme in  `./build/modules/custom/oe_authentication` so that it's available for the test site
- Setup Drush and Drupal's settings using values from `./runner.yml.dist`. This includes adding parameters for EULogin
- Setup PHPUnit and Behat configuration files using values from `./runner.yml.dist`

After a successful setup install the site by running:

```
$ ./vendor/bin/run drupal:site-install
```

This will:

- Install the test site
- Enable the OpenEuropa Authentication module

#### Settings overrides

In the Drupal `settings.php` you can override CAS parameters such as the ones below, corresponding to the
`cas.settings` and `oe_authentication.settings` configuration objects.

```
$config['cas.settings']['server']['protocol'] = 'http';
$config['cas.settings']['server']['hostname'] = 'authentication';
$config['cas.settings']['server']['port'] = '8001';
$config['cas.settings']['server']['path'] = '/';
$config['oe_authentication.settings']['register_path'] = 'register';
$config['oe_authentication.settings']['validation_path'] = 'serviceValidate';
```

By default, the development setup is configured via te Task Runner to use the demo CAS server provided in the
`docker-compose.yml.dist`, i.e. `http://authentication:8001`.

If you want to test the module with the actual EU Login service, comment out all the lines above in your `settings.php`
and clear the cache.

### Using Docker Compose

The setup procedure described above can be sensitively simplified by using Docker Compose.

Requirements:

- [Docker][8]
- [Docker-compose][9]

Copy docker-compose.yml.dist into docker-compose.yml.

You can make any alterations you need for your local Docker setup. However, the defaults should be enough to set the project up.

Run:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Then:

```
$ docker-compose exec web composer install
$ docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/run drupal:site-install
```

To be able to interact with the OpenEuropa Authentication mock container you need to add the internal container hostname to the hosts file _of your host OS_.
```
$ echo "127.0.1.1       authentication" >> /etc/hosts
```

Your test site will be available at [http://localhost:8080/build](http://localhost:8080/build).

Run tests as follows:

```
$ docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/phpunit
$ docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/behat
```

### Disable Drupal 8 caching

Manually disabling Drupal 8 caching is a laborious process that is well described [here][10].

Alternatively you can use the following Drupal Console commands to disable/enable Drupal 8 caching:

```
$ ./vendor/bin/drupal site:mode dev  # Disable all caches.
$ ./vendor/bin/drupal site:mode prod # Enable all caches.
```

Note: to fully disable Twig caching the following additional manual steps are required:

1. Open `./build/sites/default/services.yml`
2. Set `cache: false` in `twig.config:` property. E.g.:
```
parameters:
 twig.config:
   cache: false
```
3. Rebuild Drupal cache: `./vendor/bin/drush cr`

This is due to the following [Drupal Console issue][11].
